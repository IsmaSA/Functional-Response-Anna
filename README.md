### Abstract: 
Phytosanitary threats can pose substantial risks to global agriculture and ecological systems, affecting biodiversity, human well-being, and food security. Meanwhile, global warming is projected to exacerbate these threats in the future. One in Europe already widely distributed potential phytosanitary threat that may benefit from global warming is the house cricket Acheta domesticus. This study explored the potential of A. domesticus as a relevant non-native phytosanitary threat under the influence of changing climatic conditions by conducting a series of functional response experiments across a temperature gradient (20, 25, and 30 °C). Acheta domesticus exhibited comparable patterns of seed consumption and functional responses. Seed type (millet seeds, wheat grains) and temperature increase influenced the damage inflicted on seeds, with softer and smaller seeds being more susceptible to damages. These damages were amplified by warmer temperatures. The study’s outcomes underline the phytosanitary threat that A. domesticus may pose. Considering the species’ established presence and adaptable nature in urban environments, exacerbates the potential for A. domesticus to transition to rural and agricultural areas. Its increasing production as a food item, paired with the here identified potential to damage seeds, emphasize the need for proactive and science-based strategies to address emerging phytosanitary threats driven by non-native species under changing climatic conditions. As global temperatures continue to rise, the assessment and management of potential pests species like A. domesticus will be crucial for safeguarding agriculture productivity and ecological balance.
